<font size=+2>Christmas tree mobs named Spruce Willis, this is just a coincidence no?</font>

<font size=+1>
A small mod created during the WinterJam 2019 modding event!

It's that time of year again, we need a new Christmas tree for the presents to go under! So lets go see if we can catch one wandering around in the forest!
Spruce Willis the Xmas Tree
Runs away from players but travels towards Grandfather Spruce Willis.
Grandfather Spruce Willis the Wise
Walks towards the nearest village.
Shockingly summoned when bone-meal is used on Spruce Willis, or naturally when lightning strikes it.
