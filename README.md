### Getting Started with IntelliJ IDEA

1. Clone or download this repository to your computer.
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
3. If your default JVM/JDK is not Java 17 you will encounter an error when opening the project. This error is fixed by going to `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle > Gradle JVM`
   and changing the value to a valid Java 17 JVM. You will also need to set the Project SDK to Java 17. This can be done by going to `File > Project Structure > Project SDK`.
   Once both have been set open the Gradle tab in IDEA and click the refresh button to reload the project.
4. Open the Gradle tab in IDEA if it has not already been opened. Navigate to `Your Project > Common > Tasks > vanilla gradle > decompile`. Run this task to decompile Minecraft.
5. Go back to your Gradle tab, navigate to `Your project > forge > forgegradle runs > genIntelliJRuns` and run the task, once finished do the same for NeoForge `Your project > neoforge > neogradle runs > genIntellijRuns`.
6. Once you have done step 5, open your Run/Debug Configurations. Under the Application category there should now be options to run Forge, NeoForge, Fabric and Quilt projects. Select one of these and try to run it.
7. Assuming you were able to run the game in step 5 your workspace should now be set up.
